Student Performance Analysis and Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts student performance in exams using various features like gender, parental education level, test preparation course, and race/ethnicity.


The dataset, StudentsPerformance.csv, includes information about students' test scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and socio-economic factors.

Project Structure

Data Cleaning: The dataset is preprocessed by converting categorical features into numerical form using one-hot encoding.

Data Analysis : Visualisations include histograms and a correlation heatmap to explore the relationships between features.

Modeling: Two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, are used to predict students' math scores.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared metrics
